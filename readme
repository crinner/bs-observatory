### The Biased-Science (BS) Repository, an initiative of the RECOVER19 project ###

We are collecting published articles that have influenced COVID-19 pandemic decision-making, along with responses, critiques, and debunks that should get more attention in the media and public debates. 
The data are currently collected in a Google spreadsheet; contact crinner at torontomu dot ca for questions, access, and opportunities to collaborate. 

The https://crinner.github.io/bs-repository/ web site (index.html page in this github repo) uses JQuery DataTables to enable filter/search and sorting in the BS Repository. 

More information about the underlying research project can be found at [https://recover19.org/](https://recover19.org/).
